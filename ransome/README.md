# Simple Ransomware Example

## Description

This project demonstrates a simple ransomware-like script for educational purposes. The script uses the `cryptography` library to encrypt and decrypt files within a specified directory using the Fernet encryption scheme.

## Caution

**Important:** Make sure to create a separate folder and use test files when running this code. **Do not run this in a folder containing any important files.**

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you'll need to install the following libraries. Use the following commands to install them:

```bash
pip install cryptography
pip install fernet
pip install pylance (maybe)
